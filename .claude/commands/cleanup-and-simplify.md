description: Automated workflow to clean up and simplify code after development.
---

1.  Clean up unnecessary logs used during development and debugging.
2.  Remove any commented-out or unused code that is no longer needed. Don't remove comments that explain complex logic, important information, or add context.
3.  Simplify complex code structures where possible without altering functionality or behaviour.
4.  Provide a summary of changes made during the cleanup process.
