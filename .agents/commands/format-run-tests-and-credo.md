description: Automated workflow to format Elixir code, run tests, and execute Credo for code analysis.
---

1.  Run the Elixir code formatter on the entire codebase to ensure consistent styling.
2.  Execute the test suite to verify that all tests pass successfully.
3.  Run Credo against master, a static code analysis tool for Elixir, to identify potential issues and code smells. If there's something to be done, report it.
