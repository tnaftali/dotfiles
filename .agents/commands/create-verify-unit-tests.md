description: Automated workflow to create and verify unit tests for Elixir projects.
---

1.  Ensure we have enough new comprehensive unit tests for the recent work done (when necessary). If not, report back with an implementation plan to add the necessary tests.
2.  Ensure existing unit tests are comprehensive and cover edge cases. If gaps are found, report an implementation plan to enhance the tests.
3.  Verify that all unit tests pass successfully. If any tests fail, report the failures and suggest fixes.
